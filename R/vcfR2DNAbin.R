#' @details
#' Objects of class \strong{DNAbin}, from the package ape, store nucleotide sequence information.
#' Typically, nucleotide sequence information contains all the nucleotides within a region, for example, a gene.
#' Because most sites are typically invariant, this results in a large amount of redundant data.
#' This is why files in the vcf format only contain information on variant sites, it results in a smaller file.
#' Nucleotide sequences can be generated which only contain variant sites.
#' However, some applications require the invariant sites.
#' For example, inference of phylogeny based on maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods requires invariant sites.
#' The function vcfR2DNAbin therefore includes a number of options in attempt to accomodate various scenarios.
#' 
#' 
#' The presence of indels (insertions or deletions)in a sequence typically presents a data analysis problem.
#' Mutation models typically do not accomodate this data well.
#' For now, the only option is for indels to be omitted from the conversion of vcfR to DNAbin objects.
#' The option \strong{extract.indels} was included to remind us of this, and to provide a placeholder in case we wish to address this in the future.
#' 
#' 
#' The \strong{ploidy} of the samples is inferred from the first non-missing genotype.
#' The option \code{gt.split} is used to split this genotype into alleles and these are counted.
#' Values for \code{gt.split} are typically '|' for phased data or '/' for unphased data.
#' Note that this option is an exact match and not used in a regular expression, as the 'sep' parameter in \code{\link{vcfR2genind}} is used.
#' All samples and all variants within each sample are assumed to be of the same ploid.
#' 
#' 
#' Conversion of \strong{haploid data} is fairly straight forward.
#' The options \code{consensus}, \code{extract.haps} and \code{gt.split} are not relevant here.
#' When vcfR2DNAbin encounters missing data in the vcf data (NA) it is coded as an ambiguous nucleotide (n) in the DNAbin object.
#' When no reference sequence is provided (option \code{ref.seq}), a DNAbin object consisting only of variant sites is created.
#' When a reference sequence and a starting position are provided the entire sequence, including invariant sites, is returned.
#' The reference sequence is used as a starting point and variable sitees are added to this.
#' Because the data in the vcfR object will be using a chromosomal coordinate system, we need to tell the function where on this chromosome the reference sequence begins.
#' 
#' 
#' Conversion of \strong{diploid data} presents a number of scenarios.
#' When the option \code{consensus} is TRUE, each genotype is split into two alleles using gt.split and the two alleles are converted into their IUPAC ambiguity code.
#' This results in one sequence for each diploid sample.
#' This may be an appropriate path when you have unphased data.
#' Note that functions called downstream of this choice may handle IUPAC ambiguity codes in unexpected manners.
#' When extract.haps is set to TRUE, each genotype is split into two alleles using gt.split.
#' These alleles are inserted into two sequences.
#' Thsi results in two sequences per diploid sample.
#' Note that this really only makes sense if you have phased data.
#' The options ref.seq and start.pos are used as in halpoid data.
#' 
#' 
#' 
#' Conversion of \strong{polyploid data} is currently not supported.
#' However, I have made some attempts at accomodating polyploid data.
#' If you have polyploid data and are interested in giving this a try, feel free.
#' But be prepared to scrutinize the output to make sure it appears reasonable.
#' 
#' 
#' Creation of DNAbin objects from large chromosomal regions may result in objects which occupy large amounts of memory.
#' If in doubt, begin by subsetting your data and the scale up to ensure you do not run out of memory.
