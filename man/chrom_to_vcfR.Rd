\description{
Convert chrom objects to vcfR objects.
}
\details{
The chrom object is subset and recast as a vcfR object.  When use.mask is set
to TRUE (the default), the object is subset to only the variants (rows) indicated
to include by the mask.  When use.mask is set to FALSE, all variants (rows) from
the chrom object are included in the new vcfR object.
