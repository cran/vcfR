\title{Query the gt slot}
\usage{
is.polymorphic(x, na.omit = FALSE)

is.biallelic(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class vcfR}

\item{na.omit}{logical to omit missing data}
}
\description{
Query the 'gt' slot of objects of class vcfR
}
\details{


The function \strong{is_polymorphic} returns a vector of logicals indicating whether a variant is polymorphic.
Only variable sites are reported in vcf files.
However, once someone manipulates a vcfR object, a site may become invariant.
For example, if a sample is removed it may result in a site becoming invariant.
This function queries the sites in a vcfR object and returns a vector of logicals (TRUE/FALSE) to indicate if they are actually variable.

The function \strong{is_bialleleic} returns a vector of logicals indicating whether a variant is biallelic.
Some analyses or downstream analyses only work with biallelic loci.
This function can help manage this.
