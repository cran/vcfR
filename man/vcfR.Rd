\title{Variant call format files processed with vcfR.}
\description{
vcfR provides a suite of tools for input and output of variant call format (VCF) files, manipulation of their content and visualization.
}
\details{
\strong{File input and output} is facilitated with the functions \code{\link{read.vcfR}} and \code{\link{write.vcf}}.
Input of vcf format data results in an S4 \code{\link{vcfR-class}} object.
Objects of class vcfR can be manipulated with \link[vcfR:vcfR-method]{vcfR-method} and \code{\link{extract.gt}}.
Contents of the vcfR object can be visualized with the \code{\link{plot}} method.
More complex visualizations can be created using a series of functions.
See \code{vignette(topic="sequence_coverage")} for an example.
Once manipulations are complete the object may be written to a *.vcf.gz format file using \code{\link{write.vcf}} or exported to objects supported by other R packages with \code{\link{vcfR2genind}} or \code{\link{vcfR2loci}}.


More complex visualization can be accomplished by converting a vcfR object to a \code{\link{chromR-class}} object.
An example exists on the \code{\link{create.chromR}} man page.



A \strong{complete list of functions} can be displayed with: library(help = vcfR).

\strong{Vignettes} (documentation) can be listed with: \code{browseVignettes('vcfR')}.


Several example \strong{datasets} are included in vcfR.
\strong{vcfR_test} comes from the VCF specification and provides a vcfR object with a diversity of examples in a small dataset.
\strong{vcfR_example} is a subset of the pinfsc50 dataset that includes VCF, GFF and FASTA data for moderate sized testing.
The \href{https://cran.r-project.org/package=pinfsc50}{pinfsc50} dataset is available as a separate package and includes VCF, GFF and FASTA data for testing and benchmarking.
